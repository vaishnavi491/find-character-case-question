#Write a program that takes a character as input and prints either 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.
#1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z)  0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z)  -1, if the character is not an alphabet

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char ch;
    cin >> ch;
    if ('A' <= ch && ch <= 'Z') { 
        cout << 1;
    } else if ('a' <= ch && ch <= 'z')
    {
        cout << 0;
    } else {
        cout << -1;
